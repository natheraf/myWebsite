                    My name is Eric Ma. I'm 20, in my third year at Brooklyn College majoring in Computer Science, and who is graduating in the Spring of 2023. I love anime and otaku culture, spending tons of my time procrastinating school work by reading light novels and playing video games. And now, I code. I also love listening to music and podcasts.

                <p class="about-p">
                    If I were to choose between my vision and my hearing, I would choose my hearing. Music helps me keep my sanity.

                    Some games I'm playing are Elden Ring, Skyrim, and Rocket League. I played games growing up. First, it was League of Legends, Minecraft, Pokemon Sapphire, and Kirby's Dream Land (the last two on the GBA). When I made friends, I got into competitive games jumping off of League. CSGO and Rocket League. Only Rocket League stayed. I played a bit of Valorant when it came out. I dropped it because school became a priority.

                <p class="about-p">
                    League of Legends revealed my competitive edge, and Rocket League sharpened it. I stopped playing competitive games at some point in high school. Although, I still play Rocket League ocassionally. 
                </p>
                <p class="about-p">
                    Notable games I have played are Terraria, Stardew Valley, Dishonored, Witcher 3, Cities: Skylines, Payday 2, Prey (2017), Portal, Factorio, Dirt Rally 2, and my favorites: Subnautica, Breath of the Wild, and recently Elden Ring.

                <p class="about-p">
                    Music helps me through rough times. I listen to mostly J-POP, House (progressive, electronic, and EDM), and POP (mostly rock). 
                </p>
                <p class="about-p">
                    Some J-POP artists I listen to are YOASOBI, MafuMafu, Kenshi Yonezu, Eve, HoneyComeBear, x0o0x_, Aimer, Minami, ZUTOMAYO, Yorushika, Sanapri, Kirara Magic, Yunomi, and Orangestar.

                    Some western artists I listen to are deadmau5, Daft Punk, Muse, The Weeknd, Led Zeppelin, Vicetone, Jan Blomqvist, Approaching Nirvana, Alan Walker, Codeko, Galantis, Imagine Dragons, Mako, Zedd, FKA twigs, Max Elto, Illenium, Eminence, and Laur.

                    I listen to music during my commute, when I'm at the gym, and when I'm working at home. I don't have a specific genre for specific situations like some. There are times I listen to podcasts during my workout at the gym.

                    Some podcasts I listen to are Trash Taste, The WAN Show, Abroad in Japan, Hello Internet, The Adventure Zone, Cortex, Connected, Remaster, Liftoff, Upgrade, and Ungeniused (the last six belonging to Relay FM). 
                </p>
                <p class="about-p">
                    The Trash Taste boys: Conner, Joey, and Garnt are always a treat to watch and listen to every Friday and Tuesday when they stream. The WAN Show with Linus and Luke is how I keep up with tech news. The Abroad in Japan podcast is an extension to Chris Broad's YouTube channel, in my opinion. Cortex is a podcast sometimes about technology and productivity. Their hosts CGP Grey and Myke Hurley do a great job at that. Connected goes over Apple related news with Myke Hurley, Federico Viticci, and Stephen Hackett. Remaster is a gaming podcast I have started listening to recently because of their talks about the Steam Deck. The Adventure Zone is a DnD podcast with entertaining hosts and a compelling story to match.

                    I listen to podcasts in the shower most of the time.

                    I believe the best form of entertainment media are books. Reading is telepathy, said Stephen King. I can immerse myself into a story with only my eyes, allowing me to pull out a book whenever and whereever I want. In public, unlike movies and TV shows, I don't need headphones when reading a book. I can pause and resume whenever and whereever I want.

                <p class="about-p">
                    My favorite series is The Empty Box and Zeroth Maria. Other series I love are: Mushoku Tensei, Arifureta, Ascendance of a Bookworm, Average Abilities, A Sister's All You Need, Realist Hero, Spice and Wolf, Spirit Chronicles, Tearmoon Empire, Regarding Reincarnated to Slime, and The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten.

                <p class="about-p">
                    Once I get invested into a series, I cannot stop. I will read in almost every second that I am awake. I read a lot more when exams are coming up to escape them. This habit usually results in a bad exam grades. Although, I do decently in the class overall.
